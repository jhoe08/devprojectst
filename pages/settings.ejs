                        the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life
                        One day however a small line of blind text by the name
                        of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of
                        Grammar.

                        The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there
                        were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and
                        devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t
                        listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial
                        into the belt and made herself on the way.

                        Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then
                        she continued her way. On her way she met a copy. The
                        copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came
                        from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and
                        everything that was left from its origin would be the
                        word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn
                        around and return to its own, safe country.

                        But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it
                        didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers
                        ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and
                        dragged her into their agency, where they abused her
